# HRS CTF: Max + Akhil

## Project Objective

This project aims to address the lack of awareness and understanding of cybersecurity among high school students. By creating a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition tailored for high schoolers, we aim to introduce them to the fundamentals of cybersecurity in an engaging and interactive manner. The project seeks to demystify cybersecurity concepts and inspire interest in this crucial field.

## Goals

This project is very easy to modularize, as each member of the team will be able to create and deep dive into different CTF problems and specialties. For example, I could be working on a reverse engineering concept whereas Akhil could be working on a cryptography exercise. It’s also very scalable because we can create as many challenges as we can. With that being said, we want to create at least 10 CTF problems each: 3 easy, 4 medium, and 3 hard. We will try and make more but 10 each is our base goal. Each problem has 2 stages: first, we will have to research a topic (Caesar’s cipher, RSA encryption, SQL injection). Then, we will have to create an exercise. Our first goal is to create a framework for making CTF problems (a simple interface where users can navigate through a menu of different problems) and a server to keep track of the leaderboard (who has solved the most or most difficult problems). Also, certain problems may require a server, which would require starting a server by clicking a button in the browser.
